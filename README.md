## COVID-19 Misinformation Identification System
This code is from my recent journal submission where we are attempting to develop an association between twitter misinformation and COVID cases.
The segments are disjointed but am working to connect the system together into a more coherent sequence 

### CNNsent_common_test.py
Rough draft of Convolutional Neural Net for misinformation identification 

### Convertjson_v2.py
This code takes the hydrated individual tweets and coverts to a csv file that easily accessed by research team
 
### Sort_JH_By_State.py
This a segment of the code that takes raw COVID-19 case data and organizes by state

### keyword_ppe_eff.py 
This is one of the 4 keyword algorithms and shows the methodology for sorting cleaned twitter data for keywords
