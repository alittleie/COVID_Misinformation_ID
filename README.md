## COVID-19 Misinformation Identification System
This code is from my recent journal submission where we are attempting to develop an association between misinformation and COVID cases.

### Sort_JH_By_State.py
This a segment of the code that takes raw COVID-19 case data and organizes by state

### keyword_ppe_eff.py 
This is one of the 4 keyword algorithms and shows the methodology for sorting cleaned twitter data for keywords
